# Objective : Mount FSS to Remote node using Ansible 

## Ansible provides several mechanisms for error handling in playbooks, allowing you to control how failures are managed, reported, and recovered from. 

### Ignoring Errors (ignore_errors)
Use ignore_errors: true to continue playbook execution even if a task fails.

    Example:
    - name: Run a command but ignore errors
    ansible.builtin.command: /bin/false
    ignore_errors: true

This task will fail, but Ansible will continue to the next task on the same host.

### Ignoring Unreachable Hosts (ignore_unreachable)
Use ignore_unreachable: true to continue running tasks on hosts that become unreachable.

    Example:
    - name: Try to ping an unreachable host
    ansible.builtin.ping:
    ignore_unreachable: true

This allows future tasks to execute on hosts even if they were previously unreachable.

### Custom Failure Conditions (failed_when)
Define what constitutes a failure using the failed_when conditional.

    Example:
    - name: Fail if output contains 'FAILED'
    ansible.builtin.command: /usr/bin/example-command
    register: result
    failed_when: "'FAILED' in result.stderr"

You can use logical operators to combine multiple conditions:

### Blocks, Rescue, and Always
Use block to group tasks, rescue to handle errors in the block, and always for tasks that must run regardless of success or failure.

    Example:
    - block:
        - name: Task that might fail
        ansible.builtin.command: /bin/false
    rescue:
        - name: Handle the error
        ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "Task failed, but we recovered!"
    always:
        - name: Always run this
        ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "This runs no matter what."

The rescue section runs if any task in the block fails, and always runs regardless of outcome.

###  Conditional Execution (when)
Use when to run tasks only if certain conditions are met, often used to prevent errors.

    Example:
    - name: Create a file if it does not exist
    ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /tmp/example
        state: touch
    when: not file_status.stat.exists

This prevents errors by ensuring the task runs only when needed.

###  Ansible Error Handling: Retries
Ansible allows you to retry tasks that may fail due to temporary conditions (such as a service not being up yet or a file not existing). The primary mechanism for this is the combination of the until, retries, and delay keywords.

#### How Retries Work in Ansible
- until: The condition that must be met for the task to succeed.
- retries: The maximum number of attempts to run the task.
- delay: The number of seconds to wait between retries.

            Example: Retry Until a File Exists
            - name: Check if file exists, retry until it does
            stat:
                path: /tmp/example.txt
            register: file_check
            until: file_check.stat.exists
            retries: 5
            delay: 10
