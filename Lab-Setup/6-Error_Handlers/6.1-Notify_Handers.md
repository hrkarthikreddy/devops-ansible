# Objective : Explain Ansible Notify/Handlers

## Ansibleâ€™s notify/handlers mechanism is a powerful way to execute certain tasks only when changes occur in your playbook. 

### Execution flow:
- **handlers:** are special tasks defined in a handlers section of your playbook or role. They are not run by default.

- **notify:** is a keyword used in a task to indicate that, if the task results in a change (i.e., the state was altered), one or more handlers can be triggered.
