# Objective: Ansible Vault

## What is Ansible Vault
- Ansible Vault is a built-in feature of Ansible that allow you to encrypt sensitive data-such as password, API keys or any confidential variables-within your playbook or variable files.
- This ensures the secrets are encrypted and protected even when stored in the version control or shared across teams.
- Vault-encrypted files can be decrypted and used by using the correct context.

## How to use Ansible Vault

### 1. Encrypting Sensitive Data
You can create an encrypted file (e.g., vault.yml) to store secrets:

        ansible-vault create group_vars/webservers/vault.yml
    

**NOTE:** This command prompts you for a vault password, which is used to encrypt and later decrypt the file. 

### 2. Update the vault.yaml file contain:

        apache_auth_user: "webadmin"
        apache_auth_password: "Myloginpass@91"


### 3. Referencing Vault Variables in Playbooks

In your playbook, include the encrypted file:

        vars_files:
        - group_vars/webservers/vault.yml

**NOTE:** At runtime, Ansible will prompt for the vault password (or use a password file), decrypt the file, and make those variables available to your tasks.

### 4. Using Vault Variables Securely

**For example, in the Apache authentication playbook:** 

        - name: Create htpasswd file for HTTP Basic Auth
        community.general.htpasswd:
            path: "{{ apache_auth_file }}"
            name: "{{ apache_auth_user }}"
            password: "{{ apache_auth_password }}"
            crypt_scheme: md5
        no_log: true

Here, **apache_auth_user** and **apache_auth_password** are securely retrieved from the encrypted vault file.

## Using password file

### Why Use a random file for the vault password?
Instead of manually choosing a vault password (which could be weak or reused), you can generate a strong, random password file using openssl. This increases security and enables automation.

#### How to generate a random vault password File?

        openssl rand -hex 32 > ~/vault-ids/.prod.vaultpass

- This create a file with 64-character hexadecimal random password.

#### How to use the radom vault password file ?

        ansible-playbook -i inventory apache-auth.yml --vault-password-file ~/vault-ids/.prod.vaultpass


## Use of groups_var directory

Storing vault-encrypted files in the group_vars directory is a widely recommended practice in Ansible for several key reasons:

### 1. Automatic Variable Loading and Scoping

- Ansible automatically loads variables from the group_vars directory based on the group names defined in your inventory. 
- This means any file or directory under group_vars/<groupname>/ will be applied to all hosts in that group without explicitly including them in your playbook.

### 2. Organization and Maintainability

- Storing variables (both sensitive and non-sensitive) in group_vars keeps your configuration organized. 
- You can separate sensitive data (encrypted with Vault) and non-sensitive data into different files within the same group directory, making it clear which variables apply to which hosts or groups.

### 3. Security and Best Practices

- Encrypting only the sensitive files within group_vars (e.g., group_vars/webservers/vault.yml) allows you to keep non-sensitive variables in plain text for easier collaboration, while still protecting secrets.

### 4. Example

For example, if you have a webservers group, you might have:

        group_vars/webservers/vars.yml     # non-sensitive variables
        group_vars/webservers/vault.yml    # sensitive variables, encrypted with Ansible Vault
