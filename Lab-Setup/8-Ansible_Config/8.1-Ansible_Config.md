# Objective: Explain Ansible config file

## Ansibe Config File
The **ansible.cfg,** is a central component for customizing and controlling the behavior of Ansible automation. It allows users to define settings that affect how Ansible runs, manages connections, inventories, privileges, and more.


### Perpose and Importance
- The ansible.cfg file is used to set the various parameters that influence the ansible operation, such as inventory locations, logging, privilege escalation methods, SSH connection details, and plugin paths
- It enables consistent automation, by ensuring that all users and automation runs adhere to the same settings

### Location
Ansible searches for its configuration file in a specific order of precedence:

1. ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable (highest precedence)

2. ansible.cfg in the current working directory

3. .ansible.cfg in the userâ€™s home directory

4. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (system-wide default)

### Structure

This is very similar format to that of the inventory.ini file

- [defaults] : Sets general defaults such as inventory file, remote user, module paths, and host key checking.

- [privilage_escalation] : Configures privilege escalation methods (e.g., sudo, become).

- [ssh_connection]: Manages SSH connection parameters such as timeouts, control paths and pipelining. 


**Example Structure**

        [defaults]
        inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts
        log_path = /var/log/ansible.log
        roles_path = /etc/ansible/roles
        forks = 5
        timeout = 10

        [inventory]
        enable_plugins = host_list, yaml, constructed

        [privilege_escalation]
        become = True
        become_method = sudo
        become_user = root

        [ssh_connection]
        ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s
        pipelining = True

        [colors]
        host_ok=green
        host_changed=yellow


You can generate a sample ansible.cfg with all available options using the command:

        ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg
