# Objective : Elevate the privileges of user in inventory file

1. Create a simple project folder
2. Add inventory file
3. Elevate the privileges by using become_user
4. Copy file to root folder

## Solution
### Elevate the privileges
         ansible_become=yes
         ansible_become_method=sudo
         ansible_become_user=root

### Copy file to remote location
   source = ./Hello.txt
   destination = /root/
   
   #### Run command:
      ansible all -m copy -a "src=/tmp/foo dest=/tmp/foo"
      ansible all -m copy -a "src=/var/ansible-nodes/Lab-Setup/2-Inventory/Hello.txt dest=/root/" -b
   
### Copy file to remote location with specific user permissions
   source = ./Hello2.txt
   destination = /var/
   
   #### Run command:
      ansible all -m copy -a "src=/tmp/foo dest=/tmp/foo"
      ansible all -m copy -a "src=/var/ansible-nodes/Lab-Setup/2-Inventory/Hello2.txt dest=/var/Hello2.txt owner=ansible group=ansible mode=0644" -b
