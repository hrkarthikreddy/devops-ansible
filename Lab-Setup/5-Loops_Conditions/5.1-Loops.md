# Objective : Explain Ansible Loops by using Playbook

1. Basic Loop Over a List
2. Loop Over a Dictionary
3. Loop With a Range (Sequence)
4. Loop With Multiple Lists (zip)
5. Implement conditions while writing the playbooks

### Zip Explination
   usernames: ["karthik", "satish", "balaji"]
   
   uids: [10001, 10002, 10003]
   
   shells: ["/bin/bash", "/bin/zsh", "/bin/sh"]

   #### Output
   Zipped output will be a tuple or a list:
   
   (
   ["karthik", 1001, "/bin/bash"],
   ["satish", 1002, "/bin/zsh"],
   ["balaji", 1003, "/bin/sh"]
   )

- The zip filter takes two or more lists and combines them into a list of tuples or list.
- The length of the new list or tuple is same as the shortest input list, extra elements are ignored.
- Syntax for More Than Two Lists:
    loop: "{{ list1 | zip(list2, list3, list4) | list }}"
