# Objective : Types of when Conditions Used in the Playbook

## 1. Check if the condition is met (when with AND)

**Purpose:** Ensures a task only runs on a when a certain condition is met. Like, specific OS (Oracle Linux 8 in this case).

**How it works:** Can be used to check if a single codnition is met or can combine multiple conditions (OS family, distribution, and version) using logical AND, OR so the task is executed only if all conditions are true.

**Benefit:** Prevents tasks from running only when the condition is met, Like, if the OS is unsupported or unintended systems, making the playbook safer and more portable.

## 2. Check if the state has changed(changed_when)

**Purpose:** Controls when Ansible marks a task as "changed" based on the state or content of a file.

**How it works:** The task is only marked as changed if a specific condition (like a file being empty or missing) is met, even if the task always runs.

**Benefit:** Keeps playbook output accurate and idempotent, highlighting real changes and reducing noise in reports.

## 3. Task Failure Control (failed_when): Custome Logic.

**Purpose:** Allows you to define custom logic for when a task should be considered failed.

**How it works:** The task is marked as failed if a specific condition is met (e.g., a service is not running as expected), rather than relying solely on the moduleâ€™s default behavior.

**Benefit:** Provides precise error detection and reporting, letting you catch and handle edge cases or custom failure scenarios.

## 4. Conditional Task Skipping (skipped_when)

**Purpose:** Skips a task if a certain condition is true, such as a required file not being present.

**How it works:** The task is automatically skipped if the condition evaluates to true, preventing unnecessary or error-prone actions.

**Benefit:** Avoids errors and wasted effort by ensuring tasks are only attempted when prerequisites are met.
